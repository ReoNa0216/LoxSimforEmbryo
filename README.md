# LoxSimforEmbryo
Agent-based LoxCode embryo simulator. Simulates lineage from the 4-cell stage, applies time-windowed loxP barcoding (inversion/excision), and assigns tissue fates via a probabilistic transition matrix. Numba-accelerated, parallel, outputs CSVs, supports COSPAR fate coupling, and R heatmaps.
